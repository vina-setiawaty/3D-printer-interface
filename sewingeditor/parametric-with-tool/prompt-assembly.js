// Prompt assembly for the parametric-with-tool pipeline.
//
// Pure ES module -- no DOM, no network, no page state beyond the scene it
// is handed -- so tests/parametric/prompt-assembly.mjs can build every
// stage's real prompt under node and check it. This used to live inside
// parametric-with-tool.js, where nothing could reach it without a browser.
//
// Two rules shape what goes into a prompt:
//
//   1. A stage gets only the reference it needs. The texture stage has no
//      use for the piece/element geometry language and the ui stage has no
//      use for the machine's start sequence; carrying them anyway made
//      every call more expensive and buried the part that mattered.
//   2. Anything that mirrors code is GENERATED from the code (the limit
//      tables, the option specs), never written out in a doc where it can
//      drift.
//
// Each stage's prompt is therefore self-contained: it states that stage's
// own job, input and output contract without assuming the model saw an
// earlier call. Only the router sees the conversation; every other stage
// works from the self-contained instruction the router wrote.
