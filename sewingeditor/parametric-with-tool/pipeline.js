// The turn loop for parametric-with-tool: manager -> specialists, with a
// deterministic gate between calls and an intent evaluation after them.
//
// Pure control flow. Every side effect (calling a model, compiling,
// merging into the live scene, reporting progress) arrives as a dependency,
// so tests/parametric/pipeline.mjs drives the whole loop with a scripted
// fake model and no browser.
//
// Two layers, and they catch different things:
//
//   The GATE, after every call. Schema, ids, option ranges, then an actual
//   compile of what the stage proposed. It answers "can the next stage
//   even work with this?" and nothing reaches the next stage until it can.
//   A failure is handed straight back to the SAME stage as a repair, with
//   the errors verbatim and its own previous answer. Before this, a
//   rejected stage ended the turn with a retry link and the model was
//   never told what was wrong.
//
//   The JUDGE, once the chain is done. It answers the different question
//   "is this what was asked for?", against the acceptance criteria the
//   manager wrote at the start and the app's own measured numbers. Its
//   failures go back to the MANAGER, which decides which specialist to
//   re-run -- a mis-shaded area is geometry's problem, an indistinct
//   texture is texture's, a number out of proportion is the panel's.
//
// Bounded on purpose: at most `maxRepairs` repairs per stage and
// `maxRefineRounds` manager rounds per turn, so a turn cannot spend the
// user's money in a loop.
