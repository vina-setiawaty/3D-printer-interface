// Offline tests for prompt assembly (no LLM, no browser):
//   node tests/parametric/prompt-assembly.mjs

// Loads the REAL prompt docs off disk the same way the page fetches them
// (a ``` fenced doc contributes only its fenced block) and builds every
// stage's actual system prompt and user message. Guards the two properties
// the split was for: each stage carries only the reference it needs, and
// anything mirroring code is generated rather than written out.
